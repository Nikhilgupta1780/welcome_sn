            <h2>Early Life of Lord Buddha</h2>
            <p>
                Siddhartha Gautama, later known as Lord Buddha, was born around 563 BCE in Lumbini, Nepal. 
                He was born into a royal family in Kapilvastu as the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya. 
                Despite growing up in luxury, he was deeply moved by the suffering of the world when he 
                encountered old age, illness, death, and an ascetic. This realization marked the beginning 
                of his spiritual journey.

            <h2>Enlightenment</h2>
            <p>
                At the age of 29, Siddhartha renounced his royal life and embarked on a quest for spiritual awakening. 
                After years of ascetic practices, he meditated under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India. 
                It was here, at the age of 35, that he attained enlightenment and became the Buddha, 
                meaning "The Enlightened One."

                <li><strong>Middle Way:</strong> A balanced approach to life, avoiding extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.</li>
